### 1.查看cpu工作驱动模式，是否为 driver: acpi-cpufreq
```bash
[root@localhost root]# cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: intel_pstate
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 4.70 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 4.70 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 4.30 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
```
### 2.修改CPU驱动模式`GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quietsplash intel_pstate=disable"`
```bash
[root@localhost root]# vi /etc/default/grub
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="$(sed 's, release .*$,,g' /etc/system-release)"
GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU=true
GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto resume=/dev/mapper/cl-swap rd.lvm.lv=cl/root rd.lvm.lv=cl/swap rhgb quiet isolcpus=7-16 nohz_full=7-16 rcu_nocbs=7-16"
GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY="true"
GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quietsplash intel_pstate=disable"
```

### 3.更新系统启动引导文件
```bash 
[root@localhost root]# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Generating grub configuration file ...
done
```
### 4.重启生效grub，检查cpu驱动为acpi-cpufreq 
```bash
[root@localhost root]# cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq 
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency:  Cannot determine or is not supported.
  hardware limits: 1.20 GHz - 4.70 GHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance powersave
  current policy: frequency should be within 1.20 GHz and 4.70 GHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: Unable to call hardware
  current CPU frequency: 4.30 GHz (asserted by call to kernel)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
```
### 5.修改cpu模式为`performance`
```bash
[root@localhost offline]# cpupower -c all frequency-set -g performance
Setting cpu: 0
Setting cpu: 1
..........
```
### 6.设置CPU最大频率
```bash
[root@localhost offline]# cpupower -c all frequency-set -u 3.7GHz
Setting cpu: 0
Setting cpu: 1
..........
```
### 7.设置CPU最小频率
```bash
[root@localhost offline]# cpupower -c all frequency-set -d 3.7GHz
Setting cpu: 0
Setting cpu: 1
..........
```
